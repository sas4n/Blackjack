We use fxml as UI interface. So the main changes are in controller and view. We creat fxml controller based on previous console controller, same for the view. 
So we remove the previous controller and view classes. 

All the game: play, hit, stand are set on action with the buttons instead. We set the game rule, button's availability and other inital settings in the initialize.

All the Imageviews are set to be invisible before the cards are shown. To set the imageview with the corresponding card image, we use GetColor(), GetValue() from Card class.

We do not manage to have delay after each card is shown.

We continue to use observer to show card, but since observer only return one card per time, which make it difficult to set in UI Imageview.
So we create Imageview array, and set image from each card that gets from hand.
